This software is a computer program whose purpose is to submit jobs on a 
computing grid using the JSAGA API. It is composed of two modules, a JobMonitor 
meant to run as a service to check periodically the state of each nodes on the 
grid, and a JobManager that will send the jobs on the best nodes at the moment 
of the submission.
